# Lab 01 - Review and explore sentinel workspace

## Lab scenario

In this lab, participants will explore a pre-configured Azure Sentinel workspace, investigating security incidents, configuring automated responses, and analyzing data to strengthen threat detection and response capabilities within the Azure environment.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.
You start by initializing the Defender for the Endpoint environment. Next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices.

## Lab objectives
 In this lab, you will perform the following:
 - Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal
 - Task 2: Explore Sentinel workspace
 - Task 3: Onboard a Device

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Task 3: Onboard a Device

In this task, you will onboard a device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using an onboarding script.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal in your browser, start the Microsoft Edge browser go to (https://security.microsoft.com).

1. On the **Sign into Microsoft Azure** tab, you will see the login screen. Enter the following **Email/Username**, and then click on **Next**.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

     ![](./media/login2.png)

1. Enter the following **Password** and click on **Sign in**. 
   
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

     ![](./media/Lab-01-task1-password.png) 

    >**Note:** Take a moment to allow the option panel to fully load on the security portal.

1. Navigate to **Settings (1)** in the left menu bar, and then, on the Settings page, choose **Endpoints (2)**.

    ![](./media/xdr44.png)

   >**Note:** If you face any issues while opening the Endpoint. follow the url: **https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/endpoints/onboarding**
to access the endpoint resource
   
1. Navigate to the **Onboarding (1)** option in the *Device Management section.*

1. In the **1. Onboard a device** section, ensure that **Local Script (for up to 10 devices) (2)** is visible in the Deployment method drop-down, then click the **Download onboarding package (3)** button.

    ![](./media/lab01-task3-localscript.png) 

1. In the *Downloads* pop-up, use your mouse to select the **WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip** file, and then click on the folder icon for **Show in folder**. **Hint:** If you can't locate it, the file should be in the 'c:\users\admin\downloads' directory.
