# Lab 02 - Integrate Logic App with Threat Protection and XDR

## Lab scenario

The integration of a Logic App with Threat Protection involves configuring triggers and actions to receive alerts, while interaction with XDR solutions requires adding actions to exchange data, perform analyses, and trigger responses. Implementing conditional checks and logic within the Logic App allows for tailored handling of received threat information, ensuring effective responses and workflow execution before thorough testing and deployment to production environments.

 In this lab, you will perform the following:
 - Task 1: Connect the Windows security event connector
 - Task 2: Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud
 - Task 3: Create a Security Operations Center Team in Microsoft Teams
 - Task 4: Create a Playbook in Microsoft Sentinel
 - Task 5: Update a Playbook in Microsoft Sentinel
 
## Estimated timing: 60 minutes
