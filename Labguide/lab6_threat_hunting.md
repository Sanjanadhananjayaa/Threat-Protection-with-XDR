### Task 1: Create a hunting query

In this task, you will create a hunting query, bookmark a result, and create a Livestream.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type Sentinel, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace.

1. Select **Logs** from the left menu.

1. Enter the following KQL Statement in the New Query 1 space:

   >**Important:** Please paste any KQL queries first in Notepad and then copy from there to the New Query 1 Log window to avoid any errors.

    ```KQL
    let lookback = 2d; 
    SecurityEvent 
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback) 
    | where EventID == 4688 and Process =~ "powershell.exe"
    | extend PwshParam = trim(@"[^/\\]*powershell(.exe)+" , CommandLine) 
    | project TimeGenerated, Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | summarize min(TimeGenerated), count() by Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | order by count_ desc nulls last 
    ```

1. Review the different results. You have now identified PowerShell requests that are running in your environment.

1. Select the checkbox of the results that shows the **demouser** SubjectUsername.

1. In the middle command bar, select the **Add bookmark** button.

   ![Picture 1](./media/lab9xdr2.png)

1. Select **+ Add new entity** under Entity mapping.

1. For *Entity* select **Host**, then **Hostname** and **Computer** for the values.

1. In Tactics and Techniques, select **Command and Control** from the dropdonw that appears.

1. Go back to the Add bookmark blade, and the select **Create**. We will map this bookmark to an incident later.

   ![Picture 1](./media/L6T1S11-01-11.png)

1. Close the Logs window by selecting the **X** in the top-right of the window and select **OK** to discard the changes. 

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel workspace again and select the **Hunting** page under the Threat Management area.

1. Select the **Queries (1)** tab and then **+ New Query (2)** from the command bar.

   ![Picture 1](./media/lab9xdr4.png)

1. In the Create hunting query window, for the *Name* enter **PowerShell Hunt**.

1. For the Custom query enter the following KQL statement:

    ```KQL
    let lookback = 2d; 
    SecurityEvent 
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback) 
    | where EventID == 4688 and Process =~ "powershell.exe"
    | extend PwshParam = trim(@"[^/\\]*powershell(.exe)+" , CommandLine) 
    | project TimeGenerated, Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | summarize min(TimeGenerated), count() by Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | order by count_ desc nulls last 
    ```

1. Scroll down and under *Entity mapping* select:
   
    - Select **+ Add new entity** under *Entity mapping*.
    - For the *Entity type* drop-down list select **Host**.
    - For the *Identifier* drop-down list select **HostName**.
    - For the *Value* drop-down list select **Computer**.

1. Scroll down and under *Tactics & Techniques* select **Command and Control** and then select **Create** to create the hunting query.

    ![Picture 1](./media/L6T1S18-01-11.png)

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel - Hunting blade, search for the query you just created in the list, PowerShell Hunt.

1. Select **PowerShell Hunt** from the list.

1. Select the **View Results** button from the right pane. The KQL query will automatically run.

   ![Picture 1](./media/lab9xdr6.png)

1. Close the *Logs* window by selecting the **X** in the top-right of the window and select **OK** to discard the changes. 

1. Right-click the **PowerShell Hunt** query and select **Add to livestream**. **Hint:** This also can be done by sliding right and selecting the ellipsis **(...)** at the end of the row to open a context menu.

   ![Picture 1](./media/lab9xdr7.png)

1. Review that the *Status* is now *Running*. This will be running every 30 seconds in the background, and you will receive a notification in the Azure Portal (bell icon) when a new result is found. 

1. Select the **Bookmarks** tab in the middle pane.

1. Select the bookmark you just created from the results list.

1. On the right pane, scroll down and select the **Investigate** button. **Hint:** It might take a couple of minutes to show the investigation graph.

   ![Picture 1](./media/lab9xdr8.png)

1. Explore the Investigation graph. Notice the high number of *Related alerts* for *svm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />*.

1. Close the *Investigation* graph window by selecting the **X** in the top-right of the window. 

1. Hide the right blade by selecting the **>>** icon and then scroll right until you see the ellipsis **(...)** icon.

1. Select **Add to existing incident**. All the incidents appear in the right pane.

1. Select one of the incidents and then select **Add**. 

    ![Picture 1](./media/addingbookmark.png) 

1. Scroll left to notice that the *Severity* column is now populated with the incident's data.

### Task 2: Create a NRT query rule

In this task, instead of using a LiveStream, you will create a NRT analytics query rule. NRT rules run every minute and look back one minute. The benefit of NRT rules is they can use the alert and incident creation logic.

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left menu bar under the Configuration section, select **Analytics**, and then click on + create to choose **NRT query rule** from dropdown.

    ![Picture 1](./media/lab09-task2-analytics.png) 

1. This starts the Analytics rule wizard For the General tab type:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|**NRT PowerShell Hunt**|
    |Description|**NRT PowerShell Hunt**|
    |Severity|**High**|
    |MITRE ATT&CK|**Command and Control**|

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button. 

1. For the *Rule query* enter the following KQL statement:

    ```KQL
    let lookback = 2d; 
    SecurityEvent 
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback) 
    | where EventID == 4688 and Process =~ "powershell.exe"
    | extend PwshParam = trim(@"[^/\\]*powershell(.exe)+" , CommandLine) 
    | project TimeGenerated, Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | summarize min(TimeGenerated), count() by Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam
    ```

1. Select **View query results >** to make sure your query does not have any errors.

1. Close the Logs window by selecting the **X** in the top-right of the window and select **OK** to discard the changes. 

1. Under Entity mapping select:
     
    - Select **+ Add new entity** under Entity mapping.
    - For the Entity type drop-down list select **Host**.
    - For the Identifier drop-down list select **HostName**.
    - For the Value drop-down list select **Computer**.

1. Scroll down and select **Next: Incident settings>** button.

1. For the *Incident settings* tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Automated response>** button.

1. For the Automated response tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Review + create >** button.

1. On the Review and Create tab, select the **Save** button to create and save the new Scheduled Analytics rule.

### Task 3: Create a Search job

In this task, you will use a Search job to look for a C2.

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left menu under General, select the **Search**. In the search box, enter **reg.exe**, and then click on **Start**.

    ![Picture 1](./media/lab09-task3-search.png)

1. A new window running the query opens. Select the ellipsis icon **(...)** from the top right and then toggle the **Search job mode**.

1. Select **Search job** button from the command bar. 

1. The search job creates a new table with your results as soon as they arrive. The results can be consulted from the *Saved Searches* tab.

1. Close the *Logs* window by selecting the **X** in the top-right of the window and select **OK** to discard the changes. 
 
1. Select the **Restoration** tab from the command bar and then the **Restore** button.

1. Under *Select a table to restore*, search for and select **SecurityEvent**.

1. Review the options available and then select the **Cancel** button.

    >**Note:** If you were running the job, the restore would run for a couple of minutes and your data would be available in a new table.

### Task 4: Explore Notebooks

In this task, you will explore using notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel.

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace, select **Notebooks** under the *Threat management* area.

1. Next, you need to create an AzureML Workspace. Select **Configure Azure Machine Learning** and then select the **Create new Azure ML workspace** button in the command bar.

    ![Picture 1](./media/lab09-task04-configure.png) 

1. In the Subscription box, select your subscription.
