# Module - 03 : Threat Protection with XDR - Conduct attacks and Investigate an Incident
### Overall Estimated Duration: 140 minutes
## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will explore the integration of Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender, and KQL-based detections to enhance security operations and automate incident investigation. You will begin by creating custom analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel to detect persistence and privilege elevation attacks, using KQL queries to identify and respond to threats in your environment. Next, you will investigate incidents triggered by these rules, reviewing details, changing incident status, and executing automated responses with playbooks. This lab provides practical experience in building threat detections, automating alerts, and investigating incidents, helping you strengthen your organization’s security posture and response capabilities.

## Objective

Understand how to simulate and detect various cyber attacks using Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel. Gain skills in connecting Windows security events, performing attack simulations, and analyzing alerts. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Conduct Attacks**: Understand how to simulate various attacks to comprehend threat detection and investigation processes within Microsoft Defender. You will explore attack techniques like persistence and privilege escalation to enhance your knowledge of security operations.

- **Create Detections**: Gain skills in creating custom analytics rules using KQL queries to identify persistence and privilege elevation attacks. This lab will equip you with the ability to enhance your organization’s threat detection capabilities through effective monitoring and alerting.

- **Investigate an Incident**: Learn to analyze incidents by reviewing details, managing alerts, and running playbooks to automate response actions. This lab will provide you with practical experience in effective security incident management, ensuring a comprehensive approach to responding to threats.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:

- **Familiarity with Azure Sentinel and Microsoft Defender**: A basic understanding of Azure Sentinel and Microsoft Defender concepts, including incident management and threat detection.

- **Knowledge of KQL (Kusto Query Language)**: Familiarity with KQL for querying data within Azure Sentinel to create and analyze detection rules.

- **Basic Security Operations Understanding**: An understanding of common security incidents, including persistence and privilege escalation attacks, to effectively engage in lab activities.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow encompasses several essential components to enhance security operations. You’ll begin by setting up the Azure Sentinel workspace, which serves as the centralized hub for monitoring and managing security incidents. Integrated with Microsoft Defender for real-time threat detection and response, the architecture ensures comprehensive security coverage across cloud resources. Log Analytics plays a key role in querying and analyzing logs using KQL, enabling the creation of custom analytics rules for threat detection. Logic Apps automate workflows and responses, facilitating seamless orchestration of security actions based on detected incidents. This architecture also supports a user interaction layer where security analysts can review incidents, execute automated responses, and manage playbooks efficiently, ensuring a robust and responsive security posture throughout the organization.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Microsoft Sentinel**: A scalable, cloud-native SIEM tool that provides intelligent security analytics, enabling the detection, investigation, and automated response to security incidents.

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Integrated threat protection platform that secures workloads in Azure and on-premises, detecting vulnerabilities and attacks in real time.

- **Logic Apps**: Cloud-based workflows that automate tasks and orchestrate processes for security incident responses within Sentinel, integrating with Defender and other services.

- **KQL Queries (Azure Monitor Logs)**: Kusto Query Language (KQL) is used to query data in Azure Monitor Logs for detecting anomalous activities or specific threat patterns.

- **Playbooks**: Playbooks are automated workflows built with Logic Apps that respond to detected threats by automating actions, helping with timely incident management.
